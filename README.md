Mini CRM Android App
This repository contains the Android application for a Mini Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. The app allows users to manage customers and their orders, with seamless data synchronization between a local offline database and a cloud-based backend.

üåü Features
Implemented Features:
Firebase Authentication: Secure user sign-up and sign-in functionality.

Customer Management (CRUD): Add, view, update, and delete customer information.

Order Management (CRUD): Create, view, update, and delete orders associated with specific customers.

Local Database (Room): All data is stored locally in a Room database, allowing for full offline functionality. Any changes made while offline are saved to the device.

Cloud Sync (Firebase Firestore): Data is synchronized in real-time between the local Room database and Firebase Firestore. Changes made offline are automatically pushed to the cloud once the device reconnects.

REST API Integration: Fetch random company data from a public API (dummyjson.com) to quickly populate the "Add Customer" form.
